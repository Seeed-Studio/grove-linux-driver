HCSR04 Ultrasonic Ranger
========================

  There is two type device interfaces, 1-pin or 2-pin device.
For 1-pin device, trigger pin is identical with echo pin.
For 2-pin device, trigger pin and echo pin are seperated.


Required properties:
--------------------
- compatbile : should be "hcsr04".
- gpios      : should specify the GPIO hcsr04 connected to.
               1-pin device only need single GPIO or two identical GPIO,
               2-pin device should specify 2 GPIOs, the trigger pin first,
               the echo pin second.
